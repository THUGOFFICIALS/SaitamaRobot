## How to setup/deploy.

### Read these notes carefully before proceeding 
 - Edit any mentions of @OnePunchSupport to your own support chat. 
 - Your code must be open source and a link to your fork's repository must be there in the start reply of the bot. [See this](https://github.com/AnimeKaizoku/SaitamaRobot/blob/shiken/SaitamaRobot/__main__.py#L25)
 - Lastly, if you are found to run this repo without the code being open sourced or the repository link not mentioned in the bot, we will push a gban for you in our network because of being in violation of the license, you are free to be a dick and not respect the open source code (we do not mind) but we will not be having you around our chats.
